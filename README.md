# ClimateWins_CareerFoundry
This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebooks from my Machine Learning course Achievement 1 at CareerFoundry, the ClimateWins weather conditions and climate change analysis.

## Key Questions and Objectives
You’re hired as analyst for an European company, ClimateWins, a nonprofit with limited funds dedicated to using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe, and potentially the world. Because ClimateWins is lacking resources, you will use machine learning to go through large amounts of data and identify the best resources for predicting climate changes where people live.

First the analyst will determine which areas can use machine learning. Next, you'll look at data that already includes answers so that machine learning can be trained to recognize similar answers, through supervised machine learning. Then you'll clearly communicate what you found and how they'll affect ClimateWins' strategy.

●	How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
●	ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project?
●	Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
●	Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day?
